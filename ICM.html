    <header>History of The Indianapolis Childrens Museum</header>
    <p class="p1">The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis was founded in 1925 through the stewardship and inspiration of Mary Stewart Carey (1859–1938), a citizen of Indianapolis. After visiting the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, Carey was determined to create a similar museum for Indianapolis. With the help of several civic-minded women and contributions from children in nearby neighborhoods, the museum sprang to life. Over the course of 95 years, The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis has grown in size and stature to become the biggest and best children’s museum in the world.</p>
